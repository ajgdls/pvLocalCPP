pvLocalCPP
==========

Building
--------

To build, create a RELEASE.local either one directory level above pvLocalCPP
or in the configure directory. An example RELEASE.local, ExampleRELEASE.local,
can be found in configure. This can be copied and edited with the correct
paths of the modules antecedents:

E.g.

    cp configure/ExampleRELEASE.local configure/RELEASE.local

Then, to build type "make"

    make
